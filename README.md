Small Scale Solar Power Project by M/s Monex Solar Power LLP

The proposed project titled under UCR is “Small Scale Solar Power Project by M/s Monex Solar Power
LLP”, which is a grid connected solar power project. The purpose of this project is to generate clean
energy. The promoter of the project activity is ‘M/s Monex Solar Power LLP’ (herein after called as
Project Proponent or PP). PP has the full ownership of the project activity. This project is an
operational activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal
Carbon Registry” (UCR).

The purpose of the proposed project activity is to generate electricity using a clean and renewable
source of energy i.e., solar radiation. The proposed project activity of 1.095 MW is installation and
operation of solar power plant are per details listed below:

State /District/ Type /Total installed capacity in DC /Commissioning date
Gujarat Kutch Ground mounted 0.495 MW 20/03/2020
Gujarat Kutch Ground mounted 0.6 MW 31/12/2022

As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 1918.44 MWh of electricity per
annum considering an average PLF of 20%. For the project capacity of 495 kW (0.495 MW), wheeling
agreement is signed between Monex Solar Power LLP and PGVCL (Paschim Gujarat Vij Company
Limited) whereas Power purchase agreement for solar energy is signed between Ozone Procon Pvt Ltd
and Monex Solar Power LLP. While Monex Solar Power LLP with the capacity of 599.94 kW (0.6
MW) has its wheeling agreement with PGVCL. The project activities use Polycrystalline (495 kW) and
Mono perc half-cell solar photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. 

The generation of power from solar photovoltaic is a clean technology as there is no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are
emitted during the process. Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by
circuits and sealed in an environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building
blocks of the complete PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV
Array. 

Since the project activity generates electricity through solar energy, a clean renewable energy source
it will not cause any negative impact on the environment and thereby contributes to climate change
mitigation efforts.
